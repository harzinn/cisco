# Cisco Network Automation

This project provides a set of Python scripts for automating network tasks on the Cisco platform. The scripts are designed to be used with the Cisco NX-OS operating system, but they may also work with other Cisco products.

## Installation

To use these scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you'll also need to install the `paramiko` and `netmiko` libraries. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager:

pip install paramiko netmiko


## Usage

The scripts in this project are designed to be run from the command line. To use a script, simply navigate to the directory where the script is located and run the script using the `python3` command. For example:

python3 running_config.py
